            <h3>Weather Summary</h3>
            <h5>The persistent and extreme heat wave being felt across the western U.S. is
                set to continue and even expand over the next couple of days.<br><br> 
                
                A strong upper-level ridge over the Southwest is expected to remain in place
                through Friday, while only slightly weakening. High temperatures 10 to 20
                degrees above average will spread into central and northern California on
                Thursday, before reaching portions of the northern Great Basin by Friday.
                Dangerous and potentially deadly heat will continue throughout the
                Southwest and Intermountain West during this time period as well. </h5>

            A weak area of low pressure and associated frontal boundaries will fuel
            scattered showers and thunderstorms over the Midwest on Thursday. A few of
            these storms will be capable of producing damaging wind gusts, large hail,
            flash flooding, and isolated tornadoes. <br><br>
            
            The Storm Prediction Center has
            highlighted an area that includes northern/central Iowa, southern
            Minnesota, northern Illinois, and southern Wisconsin as having the
            greatest chances for severe weather on Thursday. By Friday the severe
            weather and flash flooding threat is expected to shift eastward into the
            Ohio Valley. SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms that
            extends from central Illinois to western Pennsylvania. WPC has issued a
            Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for Friday over a very similar area
            throughout the Ohio Valley. <br><br>

            Active weather is also in store for the Gulf Coast States over the next
            few days and potentially into the weekend. Scattered thunderstorms across
            the Florida Peninsula will potentially lead to flash flooding this
            evening, particularly throughout the southern half of the Sunshine State.
            Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center has highlighted an area of
            unsettled weather currently located over the southwest Gulf of Mexico as
            having a 70 percent chance of forming into a tropical cyclone over the
            next 48 hours. Regardless of formation into an organized system, heavy
            rain is likely to encroach upon the central Gulf Coast by Friday
            afternoon/evening. Much of southern Louisiana has received double their
            normal rainfall over the last month; therefore, if any tropical moisture
            enters the region it would likely exacerbate flooding concerns.
