            <p><strong>Mark Valdez</strong><br><br>
                Mark is a 21-year-old male who likes sports and outdoor activities. 
                He wants to hike with his friends during the weekend to relax and relieve from 
                stress on his day-to-day work. He heard on the news that there is an upcoming typhoon. 
                So, he contacted his friends on what their plans are or if the said typhoon will really 
                hit their place. As such he checks the Meteorological Station of the 5-day weather forecast 
                so he and his friends will know if they are going to pursue their plan or not.<br><br>
                
                <strong>Cara Miguel</strong><br><br>
                Cara is a 42-year-old outdoor enthusiast female, and she likes to enjoy her weekend fishing 
                with her husband and kids. She loves to go to the lake nearby their house and spend 
                the whole day fishing. Aside from that she also enjoys hunting wild animals together 
                with her husband. Prior to their fishing she will check on her mobile phone if there 
                will be any upcoming storm or hurricane that can hamper their plans.
