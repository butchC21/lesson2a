        <h3>Extreme Heat, Drought Fuel Dozens of Fires Across Western U.S.</h3>
            <p>
            <img src="images/heat-index.jpg" align="right" alt="US heat index" width="350px">
            Residents in several states have been ordered to evacuate due to wildfires as a blistering, record-breaking heat wave and extreme drought persist in the western United States.<br><br>

            At least 28 large fires are burning over more than 550 square miles in eight western states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC).
            
            The biggest current burn area is in Arizona, where eight fires were burning more than 375 square miles as of Wednesday morning.<br><br>
            
            Meanwhile, new evacuations were ordered overnight in Montana. Residents of some communities near Red Lodge, south of Yellowstone National Park, were told to leave their homes immediately, while others were under warnings for potential evacuations, according to a social media post from the Custer Gallatin National Forest. <br><br>
            
            A helicopter helping fight a different Montana wildfire crashed Tuesday night but the crew was safely rescued, the Independent Record reported.

            The wildfires come amid record-breaking temperatures rising well above 100 degrees in many locations this week. The National Weather Service has issued heat alerts from parts of the Southwest into the Great Basin and California.

            Salt Lake City hit 107 degrees on Tuesday, tying an all-time record high for any day of the year. Temperature records were also tied or broken in Laramie, Wyoming; Billings, Montana; Tucson, Arizona; and Helena, Montana.

            The heat combined with the extreme dryness is making conditions ripe for dangerous wildfires.

            About 89% of the West is facing drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. More than half of the western U.S. is in the two highest categories of drought: extreme and exceptional.<br><br>

            Much of the region is also facing an above-average potential for wildfires through at least June and July.

            The NWS said people in the San Francisco Bay area were reporting smelling smoke in the air Wednesday morning. That was likely coming from fires across the Desert Southwest, the agency said.
